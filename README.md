# Tender

A task management system that understands how human emotions play into task completion.

## Core Principles

- **Less is more** — Show one suggested task, not an overwhelming list
- **Emotions are data** — Understand why tasks linger (too big? unpleasant? blocked?)
- **Gentle accountability** — Warm inquiry, not guilt
- **Progress over perfection** — Kaizen mindset, wabi-sabi acceptance
- **Own your data** — Local-first SQLite, no lock-in

## Architecture

- SQLite on local filesystem
- TUI (terminal interface) first
- TypeScript
- Future: cloud sync, mobile

## Documentation

- [Kickoff Brief](docs/0000-kickoff-brief.md) — Research findings, vision, and design principles

## Status
