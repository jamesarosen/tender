# Documentation

- Plans, architecture designs, and other larger-scale documentation goes in `docs/`
- Use Mermaid for diagrams when possible
- Write JSDoc comments for exported values. Use a single short sentence unless the value being documented is particularly complex.
- Avoid inline comments that simply reiterate what the code does.
